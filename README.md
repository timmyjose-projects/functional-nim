This is a simple implementation of the `Nim` game in a functional style in Java (8 and above).

The inspiration for this is the beautiful implementation in Haskell by Professor Graham Hutton in his
book, "Programming in Haskell" (2nd Edition).

```
	$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.z0ltan.functional.nim.App
```

## Build
